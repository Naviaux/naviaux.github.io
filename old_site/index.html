				<h4 id="title">Abandonment and Failings</h4>
				<h4 id="date">2015-04-16</h4>
				<p>
					Well, essentially all of my projects are on hold currently.<br /><br />
					I've realized that the best way to do BorderlandsBot is in a web interface, and unluckily for me, I don't have the backend to support that.<br /><br />
					osu! Music Player is for the most part working, so it's on hold until something overly major comes up in the way of issues. Mainly minor things that become problematic.<br /><br />
					Upgrade Incremental is for all intents and purposes, abandoned. I did not have many ideas going into the project because of that, it failed miserably. Also having a lack of interest in the genre of game currently is also keeping me away from revisiting the game. I may pick the idea back up in the future, but for now, it's finished.<br /><br />
					In other news, I've gotten myself a coach to assist me in my gameplay on League of Legends. He is an accomplished Smite player, so I trust his judgement. As a side note: no, I am not looking to join a team at this time. No, he will not coach you and no, I will not give you his name (mainly because I'm not sure if he wants his name released).<br /><br />
					BTW: Github is hard to use on mobile devices. This is the third edit I had to do in order to finish this post. As well as a follow up commit on a PC to fix mistakes.

				<h4 id="title">Programs</h4>
				<h4 id="date">2015-01-18</h4>
				<p>
					I've decided to start keeping a changelog and download link to the programs I'm developing on this webpage, both for organization and
					consistency sake.<br /><br />
					There are currently two programs that I've added to the website: BorderlandsBot and Osu Music Player<br /><br />
					At the moment BorderlandsBot is under heavy development, but when it is done people who speedrun any Borderlands game on Twitch will be able to
					add a bot to their channel (aka BorderlandsBot) and it will have general commands for the Borderlands games for questions that are asked
					fairly often. Once it is done, I plan for it to have custom commands, timers, and various other things. However, the first release will
					have preset commands that you can enable and disable.<br /><br />
					osu! Music Player is - as you can hopefully tell - a music player. It's visuals are inspiried by a rhythm game that goes by the name of
					osu!. The objective with this was to create a music player that has a low profile on screen, but still looks nice.

				<h4 id="title">Regarding Disappearance</h4>
				<h4 id="date">2014-10-27</h4>
				<p>
					For those of you whom are wondering why there have been lack of updates on Upgrade Incremental is because I have been working on
					other projects that require a lot of planning and personal time. <br /><br />
					I have also been trying to find a job in attempt to improve various hardware and software components of my computer, though I have been
					unsuccessful thus far. <br /><br />
					I will keep this blog up to date with various information on when I will be able to resume Upgrade Incremental as well as other
					projects that I will be working on. As for now, Upgrade Incremental is on hold and when I have time to work on it, will be receiving a
					major overhaul in various aspects. <br /><br />
					Again, sorry for any inconvenience this has caused as well as concerns as to where I have dissappeared to.
